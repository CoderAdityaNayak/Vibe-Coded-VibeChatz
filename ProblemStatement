ðŸ§© Problem Statement
In many situations, people need to exchange messages, notes, or media between two devices without relying on SIM cards, phone numbers, or traditional messaging apps like WhatsApp.
Common scenarios include:
A phone without a SIM card (used by kids, seniors, or as a secondary device)
No desire to share personal phone numbers
WhatsApp or other messaging services not working
Need for a lightweight, private, internet-only chat


ðŸ’¡ My Personal Problem (Why I Built VibeCodez)
My younger sister has a phone, but no SIM card. We have Wi-Fi at home, so I thought that should be enough.

However, all her school notes and updates come to my mom's phone on WhatsApp, since that's the number teachers have added to the group. Both my parents work full-time, so forwarding messages or rewriting notes becomes difficult and delayed.

So I decided to build VibeCodezâ€”a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) that works on any device, with or without a SIM, as long as thereâ€™s Wi-Fi.

My mom can now send the notes whenever sheâ€™s free, and my sister can open the app and read them in real-time or whenever she wants.

âœ… No SIM
âœ… No WhatsApp forwarding mess
âœ… No delays
âœ… Just easy note sharing between two connected devices

This isn't just an appâ€”it's a personal fix to a real problem I faced at home. And if it helps others in similar situations, even better.
