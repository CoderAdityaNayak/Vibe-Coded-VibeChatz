# 💬 VibeChatz – A Smart, Free-Tier Global PWA Chat App

Welcome to VibeChatz, a fully installable, real-time chat app built with a clever hybrid backend using **Firebase Realtime Database** and **Supabase Storage**. 
Designed for educational use, VibeChat mimics a WhatsApp-like interface and lets users chat instantly without any login — just enter a username and start vibing.

> ⚠️ All messages and media are public. No login, no privacy, just pure chat experimentation.
